# **Mission Statement**
### 614Foodies offers a unique experience for food lovers by providing information on the best food trucks in Columbus.

# **MVP**
### 614Foodies apps will sort different food trucks in the area based on the cuisine style. For instance, if someone has a taste for BBQ then they will be able to scroll to the option for that food and bring up all the food trucks that offer that category of food.
### The routes in my application will include a home page as well as routes that will change the screen depending on the type of food truck (after selecting a cuisine) selected by the user.
